            <p>Hello Everyone! Welcome to my page!</p>
            <p> I am really excited to be part of UCLA Coding BootCamp! I have my B.A. Psychology with an emphasis in Clinical Psychology and a Masters in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance and Human Resources. I am 27 years old and I am a newlywed! I got married in October and my wife and I celebrated our honeymoon in Japan!</p>
            <p>I have a new passion and that is coding. And, to be honest- I didn't think I was going to like it and even though it's stressful- I really enjoy my time coding. I joined this program because I want a career change so I can provide for my family. I am looking for financial independence and freedom from debt.</p>
